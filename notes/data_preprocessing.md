# variables that may help in the clustering process 
* redshift - how to map them to either spatial coordinate / velocity
    coordinate (only 10% of data has redshift)

The photometric bands - assuming that they all have similar redshifts 
so K-correction is not necessary
* g-band  
* i-band
* r-band 

Have to look into the error associated with each band  
- [x] done !


Spatial coordinates
* x and y in pixel coordinates 

Color 
* g-i 
* r-i
* g-r 

The half-light radius in each band called FLUX_RADIUS_band

Ellipticities of galaxies 
$$ Ellip = 1 - b / a $$ 
where $b$ is the semi-minor axis and $a$ is the semi-major axis.
