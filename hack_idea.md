Robust spatial clustering / kernel density estimation tools -  
Astronomy data usually show clustering on some scale due to gravity. This
project tries to put together some code (maybe Scikit-learn code) for identifying clusters of stars / galaxies
and find center of mass and density / luminosity peaks. Furthermore, it
would be helpful to have some kernel density estimation tools for plotting
accurate number density contours to compare against the clustering results.
