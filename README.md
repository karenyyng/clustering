# Robust clustering / kernel density estimation / visualization tools

## Goals
Astronomy data usually show clustering on some scale due to gravity. This
project tries to put together some code (maybe Scikit-learn code) for identifying clusters of stars / galaxies
and find center of mass and density / luminosity peaks. Furthermore, it
would be helpful to have some kernel density estimation tools for plotting
accurate number density contours to compare against the clustering results.
We want to come up with a clustering method of galaxies / stars to best   

* represent the underlying structure(s) of our data 
* validate our method or show it is consistent with estimates with
other statistical methods 

I work from with very specific goals in mind but I imagine other astronomy
/ astrophysics people may have similar needs for pre-processing their data
for inference.
